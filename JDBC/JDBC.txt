JDBC:

Core Java Knowledge: Essential for understanding the API.

Database Setup/Workflow (IntelliJ, MySQL, JARs): Practical setup is done, which is often a major hurdle.

Connection Management: connections, commit, auto commit, rollback, connection close. (Transaction management)

Statement Types: Statement and PreparedStatement.

Execution & Results: ResultSet, executing select, insert, delete, update, truncate, drop, alter, create commands.

Performance: Batch Processing (crucial for performance).

Metadata: Learning to use Metadata for database introspection.

Resource Management: statement close.


registerOutParameter() is only for stored procedure OUT parameters.

executeQuery() is for procedures or queries that return a ResultSet.

You cannot combine both unless the stored procedure is explicitly returning both an OUT parameter and a ResultSet.
